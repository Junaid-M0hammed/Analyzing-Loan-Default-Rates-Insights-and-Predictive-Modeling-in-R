## Introduction
This project aims to provide insights into loan default rates and develop predictive models using R language to identify the main factors that lead to loan defaults. By understanding these factors, we can improve the lending process and reduce the risk of defaults.

## Data
The dataset used in this analysis is from Lending Club and includes various features such as loan amount, interest rate, annual income, credit score, and more.

## Analysis
The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering. Key insights are visualized using different plots to understand the relationships between features and loan default rates.

## Predictive Modeling
Several predictive models are built and evaluated to predict loan defaults. The models include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines (GBM).

## Results
The results section provides the performance metrics of the models and identifies the most important features contributing to loan defaults.

## Conclusion
The conclusion summarizes the findings of the analysis and discusses the implications for the lending process.

## Requirements
The project is implemented in R and requires the following packages:
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- caret
- randomForest
- gbm
